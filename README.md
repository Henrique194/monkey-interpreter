# Monkey Interpreter

A Rsut interpreter for
the [Monkey programming language](https://monkeylang.org/).

# Whatâ€™s Monkey?

Monkey is a lightweight, dynamically typed programming language with a C-like
syntax. It supports:

- Variable bindings (`let`)
- Prefix and infix expressions
- First-class and higher-order functions
- Lexical closures
- Built-in types like integers, booleans, arrays, and hash maps

Monkey was originally introduced in the
book [Writing an Interpreter in Go](https://interpreterbook.com/) by
Thorsten Ball. The language is designed as a learning tool, and it has inspired
implementations in many programming languages, this project being a Rust
version.
